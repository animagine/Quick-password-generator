# Quick-password-generator

This is a simple JavaScript application to create a random password generator.

## Description

The base code for this project comes with an Index.html,style.css and script.js file. The sscript.js file contains functions and arrays defining special, numeric,upper case, and lower case characters. The task was to create a logic that generates a random password based on the selected input of defined characters based on user input.

## Acceptance criteria

As a developer, this task is complete if it meets the following criteria.
    -  When the user clicks on the button, the user is asked to specify the password length.
    -  The user is given options to determine the type of characters the password would contain.
    -  The generated password would contain randomly selected characters based on the user's selection.
    -  If the user selects no option, the application forces the user to choose at least one set of character variables.
    -  The results of the password are generated as a prompt/ alert in the browser for the user.
